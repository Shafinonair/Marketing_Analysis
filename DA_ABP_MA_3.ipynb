She is particularly interested in finding out if users tend to spend more time on your website on certain weekdays and how that behavior differs across campaigns.\n",
        "- Create a presentation centered around the dynamic weekday duration, focusing on differences between marketing campaigns.\n",
        "- See whether you can apply 1-2 techniques learned in this or other modules throughout the course material to enhance your presentation on this subject.\n",
        "- Explore the data. See whether there are interesting data points that can give more insights to your presentation.\n",

Write a SQL query that would extract data from BigQuery, make a visualisation using your preferred data visualisation tool (Google Sheets / Tableau / Looker Studio) and briefly comment your findings. As we do not have session identifiers in the dataset, you will have to come up with your own logic for how you will model sessions. Have in mind that a single user can come to your website on multiple days and if you were to calculate time on the website this may have an impact on this metric.\n",
